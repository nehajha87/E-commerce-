# E-commerce-
This is a E-commerce website which mainly deals with sports equipments. I have used mern stack to build this E-commerce and  React Context API for state management. And i have used
cloudinary to store pictures and mongodb cloud to store my data and heroku to deploy my applition. And I have used Paypal integration for payment purpose.
